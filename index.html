                    The character has primarily been an antagonist in the films, whether by stalking and killing the other characters,
                         or acting as a psychological threat to the protagonist, as in the case of Friday the 13th: A New Beginning. 
                         Since Lehman's portrayal, the character has been represented by numerous actors and stuntmen, 
                         sometimes by more than one at a time; this has caused some controversy as to who should receive credit for the portrayal.
                          Kane Hodder is the best known of the stuntmen to portray Jason, having played the character in four consecutive films.

                        Jason Voorhees first appears during a nightmare of the main character Alice Hardy (Adrienne King) in the original Friday the 13th film; 
                        he becomes the main antagonist of the series in its sequels.
                         As well as the films, there have been books and comics that have either expanded the universe of Jason,
                          or been based on a minor aspect of him.

                    Pennywise comes from the Macroverse dimension,
                     that was created before the Universe. He appeared on earth millions of years ago near Derry,
                      then fell into hibernation. He woke up in 8th century America, and since then he wakes up every 27 years to start hunting. 
                      In the late 1980s he lived in the canals of Derry, when one day he murdered the main character's brother, Georgie Denbrough, 
                      biting off his hand and dragging him into the sewers. It can change its form, becoming similar to the victim's fears. 
                      One day, the Losers' Club decides to deal with Pennywise, finding him in an abandoned house where they had to face their materialized fears in each of the rooms.
                     Eventually, they manage to defeat the clown. 
                     The clown appears 27 years later, where he is killed again by the Losers' Club.

                        When creating the character of Pennywise, Stephen King was inspired by the American serial killer - John Gacy.

                    Ghostface (alternatively stylized as Ghost Face or GhostFace) is a fictional identity that is adopted by the primary antagonists of the Scream franchise.
                     The figure was originally created by Kevin Williamson, and is primarily mute in person but voiced over the phone by Roger L. Jackson, 
                     regardless of who is behind the mask (as all killers use a voice changer utilizing that exact voice, starting in person with Scream 2).
                     The disguise has been adopted by various characters in the movies and in the third season of the television series.
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Ghostface debuted in Scream (1996) as a disguise used by teenagers Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) and Stu Macher (Matthew Lillard), 
                        during their killing spree in the fictional town of Woodsboro.
                         The mask was a popular Halloween costume created and designed by Fun World costume company before being chosen by Marianne Maddalena and Craven for the film. The identity is used primarily as a disguise for the antagonists of each film to conceal their identities while conducting serial murders,
                         and as such has been portrayed by several actors.

                        The Babadook is a 2014 Australian psychological horror film written and directed by Jennifer Kent in her feature directorial debut,
                         based on her 2005 short film Monster. Starring Essie Davis, Noah Wiseman, Daniel Henshall, Hayley McElhinney, Barbara West, and Ben Winspear,
                         the film follows a widowed single mother who with her son must confront a mysterious humanoid monster in their home.

                        <p>
                            Kent began writing the screenplay in 2009, intending to explore parenting, 
                            grief, and the fear of madness. Financing was secured through Australian government grants and partly through crowdfunding.
                             Filming took place in Adelaide, where Kent drew from her experiences as a production assistant on Lars von Trier's Dogville (2003). 
                             During filming, the production team worked to ensure six-year-old Wiseman was protected from the film's disturbing subject matter.
                             The titular monster and special effects were created with stop motion animation and practical effects.

                        <p>
                            The Babadook premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on 17 January 2014 and was given a limited release in Australian cinemas on 22 May 2014, 
                            initially failing to become a commercial success in its native country. However, it generated wider attention internationally, 
                            grossing $10 million against its $2 million budget. The film was praised for the cast's performances, creature design, premise, 
                            and themes. At the 4th AACTA Awards, it won for Best Film, and Kent won for Best Direction and Best Original Screenplay, respectively.
                             In the years since its release, The Babadook has become a cult classic partly due to its popularity as an internet meme, 
                            with the titular monster being ironically adopted as a queer icon.

                        Freddy Krueger  is a fictional character and the antagonist of the A Nightmare on Elm Street horror film franchise. 
                        Created by Wes Craven,
                         he made his debut in Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) as the malevolent spirit of a child killer who had been burned to death by his victims' parents after evading prison.
                          Krueger goes on to murder his victims in their dreams, causing their deaths in the real world as well. In the dream world, he is a powerful force and seemingly invulnerable. However, whenever Freddy is pulled back into the real world, he has normal human vulnerabilities and can be destroyed.
                           He is commonly identified by his burned, disfigured face, dirty red-and-green-striped sweater and brown fedora, and trademark metal-clawed, brown leather, 
                           right hand glove. This glove was the product of Krueger's own imagination, having welded the blades himself before using it to murder many of his victims,
                            both in the real and dream worlds. Over the course of the film series, Freddy has battled several reoccurring survivors including Nancy Thompson and Alice Johnson.
                             The character was consistently portrayed by Robert Englund in the original film series as well as in the television spin-off Freddy's Nightmares.
                         The reboot portrays him as an undead groundskeeper accused of molesting the students.

                            Charles Lee "Chucky" Ray is the main antagonist of the Child's Play horror franchise.
                             Chucky is portrayed as a vicious serial killer who, as he bleeds out from a gunshot wound,
                              transfers his soul into a "Good Guy" doll and continuously tries to transfer it to a human body.
                               The character has become one of the most recognizable horror icons and has been referenced numerous times in popular culture.
                                In 1999, the Chucky character was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain for the film Bride of Chucky.
                                 He was created by writer Don Mancini and is portrayed by Brad Dourif in both live action and voice over.
                                  For the 2019 remake of the same name, Mark Hamill voiced an artificial intelligence (AI) version of Chucky as a tragic villain, 
                            having previously voiced the Charles Lee Ray version of the character in an episode of Robot Chicken.

                            Michael Myers is a character from the slasher film series Halloween.
                             He first appears in 1978 in John Carpenter's Halloween as a young boy who murders his elder sister, Judith Myers. 
                             Fifteen years later, he returns home to Haddonfield, Illinois, to murder more teenagers. In the original Halloween,

                            Pinhead also known as Lead Cenobite or the Hell Priest,
                             among other names and titles is a fictional character and the main antagonist of the Hellraiser franchise.
                              The character first appeared as an unnamed figure in the 1986 Clive Barker novella The Hellbound Heart.
                               When Clive Barker adapted the novella into the 1987 film Hellraiser, he referred to the character in early drafts as "the Priest" but the final film gave no name.
                                The production and make-up crew nicknamed the character "Pinhead"—derived from his bald head studded with nails—and fans accepted the sobriquet.
                             The name was then used in press materials, tie-in media, and on-screen in some of the film's sequels, although Barker himself despises the moniker.
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                According to Clive Barker and Doug Bradley, the earliest incarnation of Pinhead appeared in Hunters in the Snow,
                                 an original 1973 play with Doug Bradley in the role of the Dutchman, an undead inquisitor, and torturer.
                                  A later film titled The Forbidden, which was shot in 16 millimeter and in black and white,
                                   included a prop in the form of a wooden block with six nails in it, which gave distorted shadow formations under different lighting angles. 
                                Years later, during the scripting of Hellraiser, the same design was applied to Pinhead's face to give the same effect.

                             Created by Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel,
                             Leatherface was partially inspired by the crimes of Wisconsin murderer Ed Gein, in addition to confessions by serial killer Elmer Wayne Henley. The character has subsequently been represented in various other media,
                             including novels, video games, and comic books; appearing in all nine films in the series.

                                 numerous other actors and stuntmen have assumed the role of the character throughout the series.

                                The xenomorph's design is credited to Swiss surrealist and artist H. R. Giger,

                                The practical effects for the xenomorph's head were designed and constructed by Italian special effects designer Carlo Rambaldi. 
                                Species design and life cycle have been extensively augmented, sometimes inconsistently, throughout each film.

                            Large numbers of Pazuzu heads have been discovered, made from a variety of materials, chiefly terracotta, but also bronze, iron, gold, glass, and bone.
                            These heads often feature holes or loops at the top, allowing them to be worn on necklaces by pregnant women in order to protect the baby from evil forces.
                            Occasionally the heads would be attached to cylinder seals or worn as brooches as well.
                             Some of these heads have been found in graves.
                             Carved amulets are common.
                             Ritual texts from Uruk state that a woman could be given a bronze necklace or amulet of Pazuzu in order to protect her from miscarrying via the interference of Lamashtu.
                              Some are rectangular, showing Pazuzu in either standing or crouching pose.
                               Larger amulets made from stone could be hung on the wall to protect the room or an entrance.
                                One of this type of amulet that was found inside a home in the Neo-Assyrian town of Dur-Katlimmu was lying on the floor of the main reception room and was thought to have been hung on the wall facing the entryway

                            Candyman is a 1992 American gothic supernatural black horror film, written and directed by Bernard Rose and starring Virginia Madsen,
                             Tony Todd, Xander Berkeley, Kasi Lemmons, and Vanessa E. Williams. Based on Clive Barker's short story "The Forbidden", 
                             the film follows a Chicago graduate student completing a thesis on urban legends and folklore, which leads her to the legend of the "Candyman", 
                            the ghost of an African-American artist and son of a slave who was murdered in the late 19th century for his relationship with the daughter of a wealthy white man.

                                The film came to fruition after a chance meeting between Rose and Barker who recently completed his own film adaptation of Nightbreed (1990). 
                                Rose expressed interest in Barker's story "The Forbidden", 
                                and Barker agreed to license the rights. Where Barker's story revolved around the themes of the British class system in contemporary Liverpool, 
                                Rose chose to refit the story to Cabrini-Green's public housing development in Chicago and instead focus on the themes of race and social class in the inner-city United States.

                            The Slender Man (also spelled Slenderman) is a fictional supernatural character that originated as a creepypasta Internet meme created by Something Awful forum user Eric Knudsen (also known as "Victor Surge") in 2009. 
                            He is depicted as a thin, unnaturally tall humanoid with a featureless white head and face, wearing a black suit.

                            <p>
                                Stories of the Slender Man commonly feature his stalking, abducting, 
                                or traumatizing people, particularly children. The Slender Man has become a pop culture icon,
                                 although he is not confined to a single narrative but appears in many disparate works of fiction, typically composed online. 
                                 Fiction relating to the Slender Man encompasses many media, including literature, art and video series such as Marble Hornets (2009–2014), 
                                 wherein he is known as The Operator. The character has appeared in the video game Slender: The Eight Pages (2012) and its successor Slender: The Arrival (2013),
                                  as well as inspiring the Enderman in Minecraft. He has also appeared in a 2015 film adaptation of Marble Hornets,
                                 where he was portrayed by Doug Jones, and an eponymous 2018 film, where he was portrayed by Javier Botet.

                            Jeff the Killer is a story accompanied by an image of the title character. 
                            In the most notable version of the Jeff the Killer story which originated in 2011,
                             a teenager named Jeffrey Woods is attacked by a group of bullies. The fight ends with Jeff being nearly arrested for assault, 
                             which his brother Liu takes the blame for, getting taken away to juvenile hall. This resulted in Jeff becoming depressed and introverted. 
                             His concerned parents force him to go to a party, where he gets approached by the same bullies he got in a fight with before. While he manages to kill the bullies,
                              he is doused with alcohol during the fight and is set on fire, suffering severe burns over most of his body. 
                              After being discharged from the hospital and having his bandages removed, Jeff begins to go insane when he sees the burns he suffered.
                             He carves his own face to leave a smile-shaped scar, removes his eyelids, and kills his family

                                Count Dracula (/ˈdrækjʊlə, -jə-/) is the title character of Bram Stoker's 1897 gothic horror novel Dracula. 
                                He is considered the prototypical and archetypal vampire in subsequent works of fiction. 
                                Aspects of the character are believed by some to have been inspired by the 15th-century Wallachian prince Vlad the Impaler,
                                 who was also known as Vlad Dracula, and by Sir Henry Irving and Jacques Damala,
                                 actors with aristocratic backgrounds that Stoker had met during his life.

                                    One of Dracula's most iconic powers is his ability to turn others into vampires by biting them and infecting them with the vampiric disease.
                                     Other characteristics have been added or altered in subsequent popular fictional works,
                                     including films, cartoons and breakfast cereals.

                            The Rake is a strange humanoid creature described as resembling either a naked man or a large hairless dog whose sightings have been reported on four different continents, occasionally being referred to as a "Skin-Walker", 
                            with the earliest known account being a mariner's log in 1691. Named for its massive, incredibly sharp claws, the Rake lacerates its victims in their sleep and in some cases, speaks to them in a shrill voice. 
                            Those fortunate enough to survive an encounter with the Rake usually end up traumatized by its appearance and behavior.

                            Wendigo  is a mythological creature or evil spirit originating from Algonquian folklore.
                             The concept of the wendigo has been widely used in literature and other works of art, such as social commentary and horror fiction.
                            The wendigo is often said to be a malevolent spirit,
                             sometimes depicted as a creature with human-like characteristics, which possesses human beings.
                              It is said to cause its victims a feeling of insatiable hunger, the desire to eat other humans, and the propensity to commit murder.
                               In some representations, the wendigo is described as a giant humanoid with a heart of ice,
                            whose approach is signaled by a foul stench or sudden unseasonable chil

                            Description: SCP-096 is a humanoid creature measuring approximately 2.38 meters in height. Subject shows very little muscle mass,
                             with preliminary analysis of body mass suggesting mild malnutrition. Arms are grossly out of proportion with the rest of the subject's body, 
                             with an approximate length of 1.5 meters each. Skin is mostly devoid of pigmentation, with no sign of any body hair.

                            SCP-096's jaw can open to four (4) times the norm of an average human. Other facial features remain similar to an average human,
                             with the exception of the eyes, which are also devoid of pigmentation.
                             It is not yet known whether SCP-096 is blind or not. It shows no signs of any higher brain functions, and is not considered to be sapient.
                            
                            SCP-096 is normally extremely docile, 
                            with pressure sensors inside its cell indicating it spends most of the day pacing by the eastern wall. 
                            However, when someone views SCP-096's face, whether it be directly, via video recording, or even a photograph,
                             it will enter a stage of considerable emotional distress. SCP-096 will cover its face with its hands and begin screaming, crying,
                              and babbling incoherently. 
                            Approximately one (1) to two (2) minutes after the first viewing, SCP-096 will begin running to the person who viewed its face (who will from this point on be referred to as SCP-096-1).

During transport, SCP-049 must be secured within a Class III Humanoid Restriction Harness (including a locking collar and extension restraints) and monitored by no fewer than two armed guards
                            While SCP-049 is generally cooperative with most Foundation personnel, outbursts or sudden changes in behaviour are to be met with elevated force. Under no circumstances should any personnel come into direct contact with SCP-049 during these outbursts. 
                            In the event SCP-049 becomes aggressive, the application of lavender (L. multifida) has been shown to produce a calming effect on the entity.
                            Once calmed, SCP-049 generally becomes compliant, and will return to containment with little resistance.

                                Special Containment Procedures: SCP-682 must be destroyed as soon as possible. At this time, no means available to SCP teams are capable of destroying SCP-682,
                                 only able to cause massive physical damage. SCP-682 should be contained within a 5 m x 5 m x 5 m chamber with 25 cm reinforced acid-resistant steel plate lining all inside surfaces. The containment chamber should be filled with hydrochloric acid until SCP-682 is submerged and incapacitated. Any attempts of SCP-682 to move, speak, or breach containment should be reacted to quickly and with full force as called for by the circumstances.
                                 Personnel are forbidden to speak to SCP-682
                                  for fear of provoking a rage-state
                                   All unauthorized personnel attempting to communicate to SCP-682 will be restrained and removed by force
                                 Due to its frequent attempts at containment breach, difficulty of containment and incapacitation
                                  and high threat of Foundation Exposure, SCP-682 is to be contained in site [REDACTED].
                                  The Foundation will use the best of its resources to maintain all land within fifty (50) kilometers clear of human development.

                                    No physical interaction with SCP-106 is allowed at any time.
                                     All physical interaction must be approved by no less than a two-thirds vote from O5-Command.
                                      Any such interaction must be undertaken in AR-II maximum security sites, after a general non-essential staff evacuation.
                                       All staff (Research, Security, Class D, etc.) are to remain at least sixty meters away from the containment cell at all times,
                                        except in the event of breach events.
                                        SCP-106 is to be contained in a sealed container, comprised of lead-lined steel. The container will be sealed within forty layers of identical material,
                                        each layer separated by no less than 36cm of empty space. Support struts between layers are to be randomly spaced
                                         Container is to remain suspended no less than 60cm from any surface by ELO-IID electromagnetic supports.

                            The Pale Man is the secondary antagonist of the 2006 Spanish dark fantasy drama film Pan's Labyrinth. 
                            He is a pale skinned humanoid monster with his eyeballs in the palms of his hands, giving him a terrifying appearance.

                                His body resembles a pale, old man. Visible nostrils and mouth similar to those of a manta ray. He ultimately eats children,
                                 but also fairies. His eyes can be placed in the sockets in his hands rather than the face. 
                                 The table that the Pale Man sits and slumbers at is filled with all the food and drink but it was not permitted for a child to eat or else the creature wakes up to attack.
                                 Although the creature was a slow runner, he is still a dangerous monster who wants to eat a child who entered his lair.
